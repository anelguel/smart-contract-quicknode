## Anel Guel's [LearnWeb3](https://learnweb3.io/) bounty submission for [Deploying a Smart Contract Using QuickNode's RPC's](https://learnweb3.io/bounties/9bff5d28-e773-4e7d-a32a-1306058af0f1)


>In this project, I built a "Hello, World!" smart contract using HardHat, JavaScript, and Solidity. I  deployed the smart contract to QuickNode using Ethereum Goerli as my test network.

To complete this task, I throughly reviewed LearnWeb3's Freshman practicals (building a dApp, cryptocurrency, and NFT), as well as QuickNode's documentation and tutorial on building and deploying a smart contract using HardHat.

The steps I took to complete this task include:
1. Installed HardHat and other dependencies, and created a JavaScript project.
2. Created a [MetaMask](https://github.com/anelguel/smart-contract-quicknode/blob/main/screenshots/MetaMask.png) test account for this project, and obtained the private key using the Goerli test network.
3. Requested Goerli Testnet Ether from the [Chainlink](https://faucets.chain.link/) faucet and made sure the [transaction was sent to the MetaMask wallet](https://github.com/anelguel/smart-contract-quicknode/blob/main/screenshots/Faucet.png).
4. Set up the [QuickNode endpoint](https://github.com/anelguel/smart-contract-quicknode/blob/main/screenshots/QuickNode.png).
5. Created the smart contract (helloworld.sol), deploy.js, hardhat.config.js, and .env file for securing the private key and QuickNode URL.
6. After a successful deployment, confirmed the [deployment of the contract on EtherScan](https://github.com/anelguel/smart-contract-quicknode/blob/main/screenshots/Etherscan.png).

Thanks for reviewing my submission and for building LearnWeb3/EarnWeb3!
